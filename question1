Sure, here's a simple command line interpreter written in C:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_CMD_LEN 128

int main() {
    char cmd[MAX_CMD_LEN];

    while (1) {
        printf("$ ");
        fgets(cmd, MAX_CMD_LEN, stdin);

        // Remove trailing newline character
        cmd[strcspn(cmd, "\n")] = 0;

        if (strcmp(cmd, "exit") == 0) {
            break;
        }

        system(cmd);
    }

    return 0;
}

This program will prompt the user for a command with a "$ " prompt. When the user types a command and presses enter, the command is executed. The loop continues until the user types "exit".
Please note that this is a very basic shell and doesn't handle errors or arguments as per your instructions. Also, be careful when using system(), as it can be a security risk if you're executing untrusted input. This is just a simple example and a real command line interpreter would be much more complex. Always ensure to handle errors and edge cases in your code. Happy coding!
