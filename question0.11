Sure, based on the instructions provided in the image, you're asked to write your own getline function in C. Here's a simple implementation:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char* get_line(FILE* f, int maxchar) {
    char* string = malloc(maxchar+1);
    int c;
    int i = 0;

    while ((c = fgetc(f)) != EOF && c != '\n' && i < maxchar) {
        *(string + i++) = c;
    }
    *(string + i) = '\0';

    return string;
}

int main(void) {
    FILE* f;
    f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    printf("%s\n", get_line(f, 3));
    printf("%s\n", get_line(f, 5));

    fclose(f);
    return 0;
}

This code defines a function get_line that reads up to maxchar characters from a file or until it encounters a newline ('\n') or end-of-file (EOF). It then prints the lines read from the file.
Please note that this is a simple implementation and may not cover all edge cases. Always remember to free any memory you allocate with malloc when you're done using it to prevent memory leaks. Also, you should handle the case where malloc fails to allocate memory. This code assumes that the file "file.txt" exists and can be opened for reading. If the file doesn't exist or can't be opened, the program will crash. You should add error checking code to handle such situations.
